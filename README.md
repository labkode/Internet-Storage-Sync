**Internet Storage Sync - Mechanisms to synchronize client file systems with Internet-based data storage services**

This repository contains supporting documents for [ISS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cui-iss-problem-03) discussion topics that are not suitable to be tracked in the mailing list.


[Internet Storage Sync](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cui-iss-problem-03) is an IETF working draft with the following objective:

```
Internet storage services have become more and more popular.  They
attract a huge number of users and produce a significant share of
Internet traffic.  Most existing Internet storage services make use
of proprietary sync protocols with different capabilities to achieve
the data sync.  However, a single Internet storage service using its
proprietary sync protocols has intrinsic limitations on service
usability and network performance.  This document outlines the
related problems caused by using proprietary sync protocols and
missing key capabilities.  It also shows a demand for designing a
standard sync protocol to achieve better usability and sync
performance.
